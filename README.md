🏡 India House Price Prediction App
📊 Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models trained on housing data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

This Streamlit web application allows users to predict house prices in India based on several key features. Leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model, this app provides an intuitive interface for inputting house characteristics and instantly receiving a price prediction.
